--I have created this project using SQL Murder Mystery. The SQL Murder Mystery was created by Joon Park and Cathy He while they were Knight Lab fellows.

--A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. 


--crime type= murder
--date=Jan 15, 2018
--place= SQL City

SELECT * FROM crime_scene_report 
WHERE type = 'murder' 
AND city = 'SQL City'
and date="20180115"  

==Using the above query, I found out that there are 2 witnesses for this murder:
--There are 2 witnesses:
--Witness 1 lives on the last house on “Notyhwestyern Dr” 14887 Morty Schapiro
--Witness 2 “Annabel” lives somewhere on “Franklin Ave” 16371 Annabel Miller

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name='Northwestern Dr'
order by address_number desc
limit 1;

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name Like'Franklin Ave'
and name like '%Annabel%'

==After finding their information, I decided to look into their interviews..
SELECT *
FROM interview
where person_id in (14887,16371)

==I got the following information from their interviews:
--Get Fit Now Gym Gold membership
--membership number started with "48Z"
-- licence plate included "H42W"
--Last seen in gym on Jan 9th

SELECT p.*,ci.*
FROM drivers_license AS dl
Inner Join person as p on dl.id=p.license_id
Inner Join get_fit_now_member as gf On p.id=gf.person_id
Inner Join get_fit_now_check_in as ci On gf.id=ci.membership_id
where plate_number like '%H42W%'
and membership_status= 'gold'
and check_in_date='20180109'

--Get Fit Now Gym Gold membership
--membership number started with "48Z"
-- licence plate included "H42W"
--Last seen in gym on Jan 9th


== Based on the above query, I believe that the criminal was Jeremy Bowers but now I need to find the mastermind behind the murder. When I looked into his interview, I got some information:
--hired by a woman
--Height is around 5'5 (65") or 5'7 (67")
-- hair colour=red
--car make and model=Tesla S
--attended SQL symphone concert 3 times in Dec 2017

With CTE as (
select person_id,
Count (*) as visits
from facebook_event_checkin
where date between 20171201 and 20171231
and event_name='SQL Symphony Concert'
Group by person_id 
Having Count (*) >=3)

select p.*,fb.*
from drivers_license as dl
Inner Join person as p ON dl.id=p.license_id
Inner Join CTE as fb On p.id=fb.person_id
where gender='female'
and hair_color='red'
and car_make='Tesla'
and car_model='Model S'
and height>=65
and height<=67

I solved the mystery and found out that Miranda Priestly was the mastermind behind this murder
